For example, the Elcomsoft Phone Breaker product advertises the ability to retrieve iOS backup data from Apple's iCloud (Citation: Elcomsoft-EPPB).\n\nDetection: Google provides the ability for users to view their account activity. Apple iCloud also provides notifications to users of account activity.\n\nPlatforms: Android, iOS",

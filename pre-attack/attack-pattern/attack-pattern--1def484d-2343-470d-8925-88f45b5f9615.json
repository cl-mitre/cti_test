Target network would not know that their 3rd party partners were being used as a vector.\n\nDifficulty for the Adversary: Yes\n\nDifficulty for the Adversary explanation: The difficult part is enumerating all 3rd parties.  Finding major partners would not be difficult.  Significantly easier with insider knowledge.  Vulnerability scanning the 3rd party networks is trivial.",

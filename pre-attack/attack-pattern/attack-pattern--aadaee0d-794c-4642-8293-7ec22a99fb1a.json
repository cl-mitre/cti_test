(Citation: ICANNDomainNameHijacking)\n\nDetectable by Common Defenses: No\n\nDetectable by Common Defenses explanation: Generally not easily detectable unless domain registrar provides alerting on any updates.\n\nDifficulty for the Adversary: Yes\n\nDifficulty for the Adversary explanation: Requires adversary to gain access to an email account for person listed as the domain registrar/POC.  The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration.  Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or take advantage of renewal process gaps.",

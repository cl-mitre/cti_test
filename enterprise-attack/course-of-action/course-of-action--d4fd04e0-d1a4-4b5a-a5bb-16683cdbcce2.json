Deny direct remote access to internal systems through uses of network proxies, gateways, and firewalls as appropriate. Disable or block services such as [Windows Remote Management Mitigation](https://attack.mitre.org/technique/T1028) can be used externally. Use strong two-factor or multi-factor authentication for remote service accounts to mitigate an adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials, but be aware of [Two-Factor Authentication Interception Mitigation](https://attack.mitre.org/technique/T1111) techniques for some two-factor authentication implementations.",

The group has heavily targeted the gaming industry, but it has also expanded the scope of its targeting. Though both this group and [Axiom](https://attack.mitre.org/group/G0001) use the malware [Winnti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0141), the two groups appear to be distinct based on differences in reporting on the groups' TTPs and targeting.

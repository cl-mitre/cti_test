If so, NETEAGLE will send beacons via an HTTP POST request; otherwise it will send beacons via UDP/6000. NETEAGLE will also use HTTP to download resources that contain an IP address and Port Number pair to connect to for further C2. Adversaries can also use NETEAGLE to establish an RDP connection with a controller over TCP/7519. (Citation: FireEye APT30)",

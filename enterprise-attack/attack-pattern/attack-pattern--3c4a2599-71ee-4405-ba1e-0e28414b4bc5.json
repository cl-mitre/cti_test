They may do this using a [Command-Line Interface Mitigation](https://attack.mitre.org/technique/T1059), such as [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), which has functionality to interact with the file system to gather information. Some adversaries may also use [Automated Collection Mitigation](https://attack.mitre.org/technique/T1119) on the local system.",

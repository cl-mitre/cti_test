Both systems would need to be compromised, with the likelihood that an Internet-connected system was compromised first and the second through lateral movement by [Replication Through Removable Media Mitigation](https://attack.mitre.org/technique/T1091). Commands and files would be relayed from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system to which the adversary has direct access.",

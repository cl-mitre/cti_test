This is an ftpd glob() Expansion LIST Heap Overflow Vulnerability. ftp daemon contains a heap-based buffer overflow condition. The overflow occurs when the LIST command is issued with an argument that expands into an oversized string after being processed by glob().\nThis buffer overflow occurs in memory that is dynamically allocated. It may be possible for attackers to exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code on the affected host.\nTo exploit this, the attacker must be able to create directories on the target host.\nThe glob() function is used to expand short-hand notation into complete file names. By sending to the FTP server a request containing a tilde (~) and other wildcard characters in the pathname string, a remote attacker can overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the FTP server to gain root privileges. Once the request is processed, the glob() function expands the user input, which could exceed the expected length. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to create directories on the FTP server.\n[R.47.1][REF-2]",

The size of the buffer in byte was used as element count, even though the elements of the buffer are 2 bytes long. Long expanded path names would therefore overflow the buffer."

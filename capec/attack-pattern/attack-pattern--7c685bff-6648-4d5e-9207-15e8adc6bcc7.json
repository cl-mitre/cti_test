            "name": "TCP ACK Ping",
            "description": "An attacker sends a TCP segment with the ACK flag set to a remote host for the purpose of determining if the host is alive. This is one of several TCP 'ping' types. The RFC 793 expected behavior for a service is to respond with a RST 'reset' packet to any unsolicited ACK segment that is not part of an existing connection. So by sending an ACK segment to a port, an attacker identify that the host is alive by looking for a RST packet. Typically a remote server will respond with a RST regardless of whether a port is open or closed. In either case, the attacker can determine that the host is alive. TCP ACK pings cannot discover the state of a remote port because the behavior is the same in either case. TCP ACK pings are most likely to fail in cases where a stateful firewall is present. The firewall will look up the ACK packet in its state-table and discard the segment because it does not correspond to any active connection. A TCP ACK Ping has the following characteristics:\nThe tool nmap will send TCP ACK pings when the command line \"-PA\" switch is used. Sending an ACK ping requires the ability to access \"raw sockets\" in order to create the packets with direct access to the packet header.",

As a result, it is not possible to send a TCP ACK ping from some systems (Windows XP SP 2) without the use of third-party packet drivers like Winpcap. On other systems (BSD, Linux) administrative privileges are required in order to write to the raw socket."

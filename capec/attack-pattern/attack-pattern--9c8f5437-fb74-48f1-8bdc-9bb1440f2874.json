The attacker sends command \n                  strings to the target terminal device hoping that the target user will hit enter and thereby execute the malicious command with \n                  their privileges. The attacker can send the results (such as copying /etc/passwd) to a known directory and collect once the \n                  attack has succeeded.",

That is one reason why programs like write(1) and talk(1) in UNIX systems need to run setuid.\" [R.40.1][REF-2]\nIf the victim continues to hit \"enter\" and execute the commands, there are an endless supply of vectors available to the attacker, copying files, open up network connections, ftp out to servers, and so on."

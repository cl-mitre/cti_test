            "description": "In this type of attack, information useful to adversaries in launching follow-on attacks is obtained through the use of helper tools or utilities. The utilities often gather information through well-known and documented system functionality, but can also exploit flaws in the system to retrieve information that is not meant to be obtainable. The information is gathered up and delivered to the adversary so that analysis can be performed.\nExamples of such utilities include: pwdump7, Windows Credential Editor, Mimikatz, and gsecdump. Many of these utilities are in use by both professional security testers and adversaries.",

            "description": "In a J2EE setting, administrators can associate a role that is impossible for the authenticator to grant users, such as \"NoAccess\", with all Servlets to which access is guarded by a limited number of servlets visible to, and accessible by, the user.\nHaving done so, any direct access to those protected Servlets will be prohibited by the web container.\nIn a more general setting, the administrator must mark every resource besides the ones supposed to be exposed to the user as accessible by a role impossible for the user to assume. The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.",

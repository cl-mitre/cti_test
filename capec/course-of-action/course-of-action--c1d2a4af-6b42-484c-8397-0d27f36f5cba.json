Authenticate and validate all network activity originating from the database host.\nUsage: Use an intrusion detection system to monitor network connections and logs on the database host.\nImplementation: Remove / disable all unneeded / unused functions of the DBMS system that may allow an attacker to elevate privileges if compromised",
